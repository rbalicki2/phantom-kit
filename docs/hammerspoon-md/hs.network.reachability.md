# Hammerspoon docs: hs.network.reachability
This sub-module can be used to determine the reachability of a target host. A remote host is considered reachable when a data packet, sent by an application into the network stack, can leave the local device. Reachability does not guarantee that the data packet will actually be received by the host.

It is important to remember that this module works by determining if the computer has a route for network traffic bound to a specific destination.  An active internet connection provides a default route for any network that the host is not a member of, so care must be used when testing for specific VPN or local networks to avoid false positives.  Some examples follow:
