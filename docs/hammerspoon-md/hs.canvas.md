# Hammerspoon docs: hs.canvas
A different approach to drawing in Hammerspoon

This module works by designating a canvas and then assigning a series of graphical primitives to the canvas.  Included in this assignment list are rules about how the individual elements interact with each other within the canvas (compositing and clipping rules), and direct modification of the canvas itself (move, resize, etc.) causes all of the assigned elements to be adjusted as a group.
